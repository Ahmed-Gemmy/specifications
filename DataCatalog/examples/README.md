## DataCatalog coding examples.

This folder contains example markup for the DataCatalog profile generated by the [Data Repositories group](http://bioschemas.org/groups/DataRepositories/).
Examples are purely illustrative and may use fictional data. Each example should
indicate which version of the profile it is valid for. Please check to ensure the example
you are reading matches the version of the profile you are interested in.

# Creating your own datacatalog metadata
1) Copy the template.json example.
2) Change the values of the minimum fields.
3) Add as many recommended and optional fields as possible.
4) Wrap up the example using script tags.
```
<script type="application/ld+json">
  ....
</script>
```
4) Embed the example in your landing page.
